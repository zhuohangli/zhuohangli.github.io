Hello and welcome! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Previously, I earned my MS from [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/) and my BS from [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).

I am generally interested in topics within the field of trustworthy machine learning, with the goal of understanding the failure modes of ML models and designing robust, private, and generalizable ML systems for security and privacy critical applications.
