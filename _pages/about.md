I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Previously, I earned my MS from [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/) and my BS from [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).

My interest is in the field of trustworthy machine learning. My work aims to improve the understanding of the failure modes of machine learning models to assist the design of _robust_, _private_, and _generalizable_ machine learning systems for security and privacy critical applications.
